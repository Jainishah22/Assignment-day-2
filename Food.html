                            <td><b> The vada pav recipe is extremely simple to prepare, yet i would like to add few tips and recommendations while preparing.
                                 firstly, ensure the boiled and mashed potatoes are moisture free and removed immediately from pressure cooker after it is cooked.
                                  if you feel you mashed potatoes contain moisture, fry them in a pan for 2-3 minutes to remove it. secondly, i have added baking soda to the besan batter to make vadas crisper.
                                   also, add 1 tbsp of rice flour/cornflour to make it even crisper. lastly, these vada pav should be served immediately after deep frying and assembling. 
                                alternatively, you can place the deep fried vadas in a preheated oven or even deep fry again for 1 minute if serving later. </b></td>

                            <td><b> Dabeli, kutchi dabeli or double roti (Gujarati:દાબેલી,કચ્છી દાબેલી, Devnagari: दाबेली,कच्छी दाबेली) is a popular snack food of India, originating in the Kutch or Kachchh region of Gujarat.
                                     It is a sweet snack made by mixing boiled potatoes with a special dabeli masala, putting the mixture in a ladi pav (burger bun), and serving it with chutneys made from tamarind, date, garlic, red chilies and other ingredients. 
                                    It is garnished with pomegranate and roasted peanuts.
                                    Dabeli literally means "pressed" in Gujarati language. The dish is said to have been invented by Keshavji Gabha Chudasama (also known as Kesha Malam), a resident of Mandvi, Kutch, in the 1960s. 
                                    When he started business he sold dabeli at the price of one anna or six paisa. His shop is still there in Mandvi, run by a later generation of his family.[2] Today, dabeli masala made in the Kutch region are said to be most authentic.
                                    [citation needed] Bhuj and Nakhatrana towns of Kutch are also known for authentic dabeli apart from Mandvi.</b> </td>
